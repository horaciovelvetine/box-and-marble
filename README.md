# Box and Marble Logic Puzzle

[üåê **Live Demo**](https://horaciovelvetine.github.io/box-and-marble/)

A classic logical reasoning challenge implemented as an interactive web application. Test your deductive reasoning skills with this engaging puzzle that combines visual elements with logical thinking.

## The Puzzle

Imagine you are given 3 matchboxes labeled: "Red and White", "Red and Red", and "White and White". Each box contains 2 marbles which can be either red or white. **The labels on each box are incorrect** (although the labels would be correct if you switched them around). You are allowed to peek inside one box and look at exactly one marble in that box. Can you figure out what's in each box and label them correctly?

### Key Questions to Consider

- Can you figure out what is in each box and fix the labels to be correct? 
- Does it matter which box you choose to open at the start? 
- Does this puzzle rely on inductive or deductive reasoning? 
- Can you be sure of your answer?

### The Facts

You are given 3 matchboxes with *incorrect labels*:
- **"Red and White"** 
- **"Red and Red"**   
- **"White and White"** 

There are a total of 6 marbles - 3 red and 3 white.
